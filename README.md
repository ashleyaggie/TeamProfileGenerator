## Description

In this assignment, we were tasked with creating an application in which the user answers multiple questions and the answers are then used to populate a README.md file. This is the first time I've used a Table of Contents, and honestly prior to this I forgot you could make one!

This was an interesting test in seeing how far the capabilities of a Markdown can go, and how using different functions and JavaScript files work together to create a cleaner application. I originally was just working in the index.js until I found the generateMarkdown.js and at first, I got really tripped up by it. After I figured out how to make the prompts from Inquirer flow correctly and utilize the generateMarkdown functions, I felt a lot better about it. I did wind up changing some arguments in the functions, because I felt they flowed better with the process I wrote.

Unable to be deployed.

## Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input

WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information

THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

    * Used Inquirer to gather information and fs.writeFile to create the HTML file with the information

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML

THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

    * Used an anchor tag linked to mailto: and email variable to allow it to be clicked on and open in the local email application

WHEN I click on the GitHub username

THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab

    * Used an anchor tag with the url and the github variable to link to the github

WHEN I start the application

THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

    * On initialization, runs a function that prompts the user for the manager's information.

WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

    * After the manager's prompt, it runs a function prompting the user whether they want to add another team member

    * Runs another function depending on the response

WHEN I select the engineer option

THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

    * When choosing engineer, it will run a function to prompt for the engineer's information

WHEN I select the intern option

THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

    * When choosing intern, it will run a function to prompt for the intern's information

WHEN I decide to finish building my team

THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated

    * When choosing I'm done adding team members, the application runs a function to generate the HTML and write the file.

## Installation

Files must be downloaded from Github. Then, run npm install to get the necessary node modules. Last, run node index.js.

## Usage

This is an application in which the user answers multiple questions in the terminal and the answers are then used to populate an HTML file.
